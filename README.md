   PyAutoGUI is required for bot functions, it moves the mouse and adds your information

## Notes

The bot was designed to run in chrome, you must have bookmarks for the bot to have proper formatting.
The bot is hard codded to work on my laptop screen so it may require some adjustment.
I may add AI to find and fill out the form, making it work on any screen but for now it's hard coded to only work on mines.
